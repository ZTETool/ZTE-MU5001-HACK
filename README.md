# ZTE-MU5001 BROWSER HACK

## ABOUT

This fork of [ZTE-MU5001-BROWSER-HACK](https://github.com/githubxbox/ZTE-MU5001-BROWSER-HACK]) improves documentation regarding available menus, provides the original approach of copy-paste from the V1 and adds an experimental Firefox extension, the code was also refactored in order to be more readable and make it easier for any further extension or modifications, and in the future I plan to do some CSS changes.

## INSTALATION

- For the V1 just copy and paste the code in the browser console as usual(works in any browser).

- For the V2, load it as an unpacked extension in Firefox. Open the `about:debugging` page, click "This Firefox" on the left, and then click "Load Temporary Add-on." Select the `manifest.json` file in your extension directory where you downloaded this project. The extension will run automatically when the active tab is `http://192.168.0.1/*`.
